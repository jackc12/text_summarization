# text_summarization
This project aims to summarize text using Deep Learning. The aim of this project is to build a model capable of extracting and organizing the most relevant information conveyed through text. The dataset used in this project is the WikiHow dataset for text summarization. The WikiHow dataset contains articles written by normal people describing how to complete tasks from a wide range of topics so it should generalize well. The input for the model will be the articlesâ€™ content and the output for the model will be the lines in bold text. The model used in this task is an Encoder Decoder sequence to sequence model. A sequence to sequence model is a model capable of mapping a fixed length input to a fixed length output where the lengths of the input and output may differ. The summaries will be evaluated using ROUGE tests.
